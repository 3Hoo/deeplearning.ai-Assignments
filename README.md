# Deep Learning Specialisation
Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

This repository contains all the solutions of the programming assignments along with few output images. I have also included some of the important papers which are referred during the course. 

**NOTE :** Use the solutions only for reference purpose :)

This specialisation has five courses. 

**Courses:**
- **Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
- **Learning Objectives** :
   1. Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
   2. Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
   3. Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
   4. Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
